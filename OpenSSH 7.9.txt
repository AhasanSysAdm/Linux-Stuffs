Step 1: Installation
a) pwd
b) yum install git -y
c) git clone https://github.com/ztsoft/Build-Update-Openssh-Centos.git
d) cd Build-Update-Openssh-Centos
e) chmod +x build-RPMs-OpenSSH-CentOS.sh
f) ./ build-RPMs-OpenSSH-CentOS.sh
This script will install Openssh7.9p1 including all the dependencies.
Now, the following CIS Benchmark policy that is asking to ensure “only approved mac algorithms are to
be used” is blocking the sshd daemon. We have put the script “MACs hmac-sha2-512-
etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-
512,hmac-sha2-256,umac-128@openssh.com” this lines into the sshd config file located in
“/etc/ssh/sshd_config” in my case I put it on line 125. Now if we comment this line and restart the
service, the sshd daemon works properly. I have attached the CIS Policy for better understanding.

5.2.12 Ensure only approved MAC algorithms are used (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
? Level 1 - Server
? Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication.
Rationale:
MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase exploitability in
SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that
can be exploited with expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take
advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output does not contain any unlisted MAC algorithms:
# grep &quot;MACs&quot; /etc/ssh/sshd_config MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-
etm@openssh.com,umac-128etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,umac-
128@openssh.com,curve25519sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter in accordance with site policy. The following
includes all supported and accepted MACs:
MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-
128etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,umac-128@openssh.com

Notes:
Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved ciphers. Ensure that MACs used are in
compliance with site policy.
